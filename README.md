# Virtual-Piano
This webpage features a small piano that plays audio of different notes when different keys on the keyboard are pressed. The piano keys are labled with the letters of the keyboard keys that need to be pressed to play it. The purpose of this project was to learn taking key input and playing audio. This project was done as part of the "Frontend Developer" course on Hyperskill.
